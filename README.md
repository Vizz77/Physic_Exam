# Exam Archive

This repository contains a small web application that serves as an archive of physics exam topics. The site was created by a student as a personal project to collect exercises and short notes in a single place. It is built with **React** and **Vite** to keep the setup lightweight and easy to maintain.

## Purpose

The goal of the application is to provide an easy way to browse common physics exam questions and related material. It can be expanded to host additional resources or solutions over time.

## React + Vite Template

The project started from the official Vite template which provides a minimal setup to get React working with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
